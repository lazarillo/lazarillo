👋 Hi, I’m Mike Williamson ( @lazarillo )

I got into coding via data science, back when it was still called statistics. Over the years I have moved into machine learning and data engineering, picking up infra-as-code and Dev(Sec)Ops along the way. I enjoy the product side of making code as well: ensuring that what I'm making is useful, solving a problem, and sufficiently generalized to be able to grow.

My most proficient language is Python, but I'm currently learning Rust because it allows for fast calculations, along with all of its other benefits. I've also dipped into MCP servers / clients and agent development kits, to safely inject agentic AI into software solutions.
