ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @lazarillo

I've spent most of my career as a data scientist, but I have recently moved to focus more heavily on the DevSecOps side of that world, trying to better learn how to build and maintain robust, secure machine learning products and pipelines.

I also have a side passion of rekindling some creative writing I used to enjoy, and a passion to help women find opportunities in the tech / software / data science world.
